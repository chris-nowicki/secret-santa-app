              Let's get down to business - Secret Santa style! In case you're
              not familiar with this holly jolly tradition, here's the scoop:
              each person will be handed a name out of Santa's mystical hat and
              become their very own gift-giver extraordinaire. You'll surprise
              them with a present that will make their heart sing Christmas
              carols!

              To secure your spot among Santa's little helpers, please RSVP
              clicking on this link:
            </Text>
            <Link href={props.link}>{props.link}</Link>
            <Text className="font-sans">
              If you're able to come, you'll receive access to fill out your own
              wish list with gift ideas that would make you say, "Oh, deer, it's
              perfect!" Once everyone has completed their lists, we'll send out
              a second email revealing who you'll be hunting down the perfect
              present for.
